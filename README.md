# All in one Sudoku experience
Have you ever wanted to solve a sudoku but only found app crowded with disgusting ads? This is the right place for you!

I, myself, am an enjoyer of sudokus, so I decided to create an app that lets you fill in the blank grid with the numbers you want so you can complete all of your sudokus in peace.

It also comes with a resolver (I highly suggest you git gud so don't use it) and a special mode in which the all the numbers you put in the grid can, all at once, be deleted or added: this feature can be used for the ambigous moments where you have too many choices and risk reiterating back because of an error.

It's an early version of an app made for fun, don't expect much. For now, the app is optimized for 1920x1080 monitors, so sorry about that. 

If you want to play, install pygame and run sudoku.py.

Enjoy!
